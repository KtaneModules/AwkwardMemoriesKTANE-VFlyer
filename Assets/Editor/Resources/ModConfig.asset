  description: 'Macro Memory ver 1.0

    Memory is... uh... mem- memory is fra.. fragrant? No, fragile. Memory is fragile
    and... where was I again? Oh yes, always pay attention.

    Five stages of pressing a number, but the answer depends on previously pressed
    numbers and the positions those numbers where in. Multiple Macro Memory modules
    combine into a bigger puzzle.
